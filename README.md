This Python program is designed to classify images into 'empty' or 'non_empty' categories using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). It reads images from a specified directory, processes them, and extracts features. The data is then split into training and testing sets. An SVM model is trained using grid search and cross-validation to find the best hyperparameters, ensuring optimal performance. The program handles imbalanced data by adjusting the class distribution. After training, the model is evaluated for accuracy, aiming to achieve robust and accurate classification results for the given image dataset.
